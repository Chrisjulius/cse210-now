# Future improvement on Prove Project  
1. The journal program should utilize a .csv file to save journals replacing the text file usage.  
2. The scripture memorizer:
    * If a word is erased let the underscore be equal to the number of characters for that word
    * Optimize your code generally (review instructor's comment)  
    * Let the Program class hold the actual scripture passage to be memorized not the Word class
